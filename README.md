People searching for companionship online presents a prime opportunity for cybercriminals to play on emotions and exploit vulnerabilities. **CyberCupid** is how we secure this battleground. Protection is not just an afterthought, it defines the application.

## Roadmap

While our idea does a lot to get the message about prudence on the internet, it could have a stronger impact. Here are a few features we aim to implement going forward.

### Threat Simulation

The goal is to simulate realistic attacks on out users to build their readiness to defend themselves when its a real attack.

### Cross platform defense

Our edge technology can be integrated into other social media applications users employ to be a full-time digital bodyguard.

### Making calls

This allows us to defend another communication dimension, providing more all round security.
